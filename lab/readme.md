# Laboratory of researches

## Introduction

This directory is reserved exclusively for the parallel development of solutions. 

## The work

The work carried out here is an alternative solution to the project already in place. It focuses on the binairasion part and the selection of elements to be transformed for the game. The game is graphically developed using the Tkinter library. 

## The problem

The current problem is not only the porting to different operating systems, but also the layout of the graphical 'pages'. The user interface can be improved and lacks intuitiveness. 

When running the python script hanjie.py, the sliders for selecting binarisation and image size are sometimes incorrectly positioned, don't work or don't exist. The second problem concerns the image display. The initial objective is to display the image in real time of the image being binarised, but it is not always displayed depending on the OS.
